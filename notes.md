# Notes on VentureLab "interval study"

- based on analysis in Nov 2012 (Golemi / Rosintoski / Youtie)

# Overall goal
- demonstrate that I-Corps reduces wasted time and money
    by getting to a go/no-go decision sooner


# Questions
- is our "first touch date" a valid starting point? Can we assess
  time saved if PI has been working on product well before contacting us?
    - we don't know "disclosure date"
    - and it's often after people contact us


# Analysis
- only including projects that have more than one date
- earliest I-Corps team started 10/1/2011 at Stanford (first cohort?)
    - should go by I-Corps start date plus six weeks
    - I-Corps end date is start + six months I think (grant duration)
        - not for everybody...

- what should we actually track?
    - time deltas: contact to GRA I, GRA I to GRA II, GRA II to GRA III
        - figure that for each of three groups
            - pre I-Corps (contact < 1/1/2012)
            - post I-Corps, participating
            - post I-Corps, non-participating


# Presentation
- can do a lot of this with Jupyter
- publish Jupyter notebook with option to export to Excel
